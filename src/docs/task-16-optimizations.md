- Image optimization with lazy loading
- Bundle splitting and code optimization

### 4. Memory Management
- Automatic cleanup of performance entries
- Memory usage monitoring
- Blob cleanup for audio files
- Event listener cleanup utilities

## UI Polish and Enhancements

### 1. Visual Improvements
- **Enhanced Header**: Added gradient background with Sparkles icons
- **Improved Animations**: Smooth fade-in effects and staggered animations
- **Better Typography**: Gradient text effects for branding
- **Enhanced Cards**: Hover effects and better visual hierarchy

### 2. Accessibility Enhancements
- Focus-visible improvements
- High contrast mode support
- Reduced motion preferences
- Better keyboard navigation

### 3. Mobile Optimizations
- Safe area support for notched devices
- Optimized touch targets
- Improved scrollbar styling
- Better responsive design

## Technical Integrations

### 1. App Optimizer Component
- Centralized optimization initialization
- Service worker integration
- Performance monitoring setup
- Memory management
- Critical resource preloading

### 2. Enhanced CSS
- GPU acceleration for smooth animations
- Custom scrollbar styling
- Shimmer loading effects
- Recording pulse animations
- Backdrop blur optimizations

### 3. Development Tools
- Performance debugger (development only)
- Bundle analyzer
- Memory usage monitoring
- Performance metrics collection

## Performance Metrics

### Core Web Vitals Monitoring
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) tracking
- First Input Delay (FID) measurement
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) monitoring
- Custom performance metrics

### Bundle Analysis
- **Scripts**: Optimized loading
- **Stylesheets**: Minimized and compressed
- **Estimated Size**: ~153KB total shared JS
- **Next.js Chunks**: Efficiently split

## Security Enhancements

### Headers Added
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

### Caching Strategy
- Static assets: 1 year cache
- Service worker: No cache (always fresh)
- Dynamic content: Stale-while-revalidate

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. Loading States
- Smooth loading animations
- Progressive enhancement
- Skeleton loading states
- Error boundaries with recovery

### 2. Visual Feedback
- Enhanced notifications with animations
- Recording state indicators
- Progress indicators
- Status updates

### 3. Responsive Design
